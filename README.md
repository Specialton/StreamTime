StreamTime
==========

An online opensource time management system for non business time scheduling focused on solutions centered around situations and time focused for each participant.

# Purpose #
This time management system is to help manage time from each role's perspective across the different organizations involved.   From each perspective, StreamTime will manage the information sharing via an online GUI, as well as notifications via appropriate communication and social media channels.

1. Manager (or member of Manager team)logs in and creates the many tasks, based on clients needs [maybe client logs in and creates schedules]
1. volunteers have their own accounts and login and indicate their availability 
1. system assigns tasks to people based on their availability [future functionality would incorporate preference as well]
1. system emails each volunteer with their schedule and tasks, and handles preset confirmations and adjustments made by confirmations and

Include typical interactions with potential issues 
  
###Signup###
  Shift/Event postings
  Availability
  Unique event ID - (DDMMLST4 - Bday DD + Bday MM + last 4 of SSN) [need to think of optional alternate suggestion]

  Management needs to be able to decide about the position level of a potential staff. should include resume or something similar, or maybe a ranking by management for preference.

###Distribution/Confirmation of Schedule###
  If online posting, have 
  Prohibited items or security information should be distributed, and health/weather relate information
###change of schedules###


### Reconfirmation ###

Some features that I would like to address would be:

Client  (must be presented in a fashion to explain the capabilities of the program , and some form of ticket system to add functionality that doesn't exits)

* Planning capabilities
  * personnel counts
  * shift counts
  * personnel costs
  * breaks/lunches/downtime considerations
  * cost(s)
    * promo/thank you/trinket/tchotchkes 

Manager - (ultimately trying to minimize the hours put in to manage the different needs of people and shifts in scheduling when an anomaly is encountered)

* from a high level position: (this would benefit professors and the like)
  * if you would like to schedule a once a week meeting with X number of people, this would allow those people to give possible times, and if people include some flexible prioritized time slots, then the scheduler would be able to schedule the most people without it being first come first serve reply.
* collection
     * of peoples shift preference
     * scheduled vs needed positions (attrition)
* distribution of schedules to people both scheduled and emergency via text/email/phone/phone tree            
* grouping of similar tasks

Staff (attempting to personalize this approach as much as possible)

* from a volunteer position:
  * A view to see open time slots and positions, including any hierarchal position structures (team lead/captain, worker, info, find raiser)
  * a short survey that would help you determine which area is most likely fitted to what you want/skilled at
  * priority/scheduled vs backup shifts
* from a paid perspective
  * clock/check in/out for timekeeping
  * invoicing for paycheck

All three will have considerations for typical organization trees and positions.
