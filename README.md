1. system assigns tasks to people based on their availability [future functionality would incorporate preference as well]
1. system emails each volunteer with their schedule and tasks, and handles preset confirmations and adjustments made by confirmations and

# Considerations: #

## Reporting: ##
  * position counts per specific groups
  * personnel counts
  * shift counts
    * scheduled / confirmed / open / attrition
  * Item allocations and counts
  * IRS / payment information for individuals
  * Clock in / clock out

  
## Signup ##
  * Shift/Event postings
  * personal Availability
  * Unique event ID - (DDMMLST4 - Bday DD + Bday MM + last 4 of SSN) [need to think of optional alternate suggestion]
  * View open schedules and position information
  * Management needs to be able to decide about the position level of a potential staff. should include resume or something similar, or maybe a ranking by management for preference.

## Schedule(s) ##
  * Distribution/Confirmation of Schedule
    * should include:
      * Prohibited Items / Security information
      * Health / Weather related information
      * Uniform information
    * Scheduled and firecall distributions
  * Breaks / Lunches / Downtime considerations
  * MGMT
    * Initial scheduling on first 
    * see who's schedule has changed during whatever period (maybe from day to day, but maybe from schedule to schedule, ideas?)
    * Phone call log for non-confirmed up staffers
  * Reconfirmation 
    * 

## Retention ##
  * Best practices
  * Documents
  * Ticketing / Reporting for:
    * Venue issues (negative practices)
    * Program issues

## Access ##
  * Documents (ISO standards)
    * Acronyms
    * Organization Hierarchy

## Staff ##
  * Group
    * A group must be able to signup to cover shifts collectively, with a point of contact / representative
  * Paid
    * Complete Pay stub (should reflect / enhance Reporting)
  * Volunteer
    * Milestones (maybe keeping track across multiple events?)
    * promo / thank you / trinket / tchotchke
    * a short survey that would help you determine which area is most likely fitted to what you want / skilled at

## Cost(s)
  * Venue
  * Personnel
    * item(s)

Other Scheduling Algorithm
* from a high level position: (this would benefit professors and the like)
  * if you would like to schedule a once a week meeting with X number of people, this would allow those people to give possible times, and if people include some flexible prioritized time slots, then the scheduler would be able to schedule the most people without it being first come first serve reply
* collection
   * of peoples shift preference
___

### Incomplete thoughts / requirements: ###
  * All four will have considerations for typical organization trees and positions.
  * grouping of similar tasks
  * Time buffers on shifts
  * Compare positions, employees, shifts, locations, and overlook/meta data.
  * Monitor deletions, reassignments, other events
  * job roles and functions in distribution packets
  * Enhancement
  * Those who want to work more hours
