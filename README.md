1. have a bunch of tasks/time slots that need to be filled
1. have a bunch of individuals with different schedules that need to cover all the tasks/timeslots
1. volunteer coordinator logs in and creates the many tasks
1. volunteers have their own accounts and login and indicate their availability 
1. system assigns tasks to people based on their availability
1. system emails each volunteer witht their tasks

So far I ultimately believe every situation includes a Host, a Visitor, and people.   the host would include everyone that is involved at the particular location that the event occurs.   The visitor is the group/people/person that wants to have the event, and the people are those that either are paid or volunteer, and do the actual work (including mgmt of the people).  So people and roles obviously can overlap with smaller scaled events, and this would be accomodated, but ultimately these are the only stakeholders I can identify.  If you can identify others, please let me know)

Some features that I would like to address would be:

Visitor  (must be presented in a fashion to explain the capabilities of the program , and some form of ticket system to add functionality that doesn't exits)

* Planning capabilities
  * personel counts
  * shift counts
  * personel costs
  * breaks/lunches/downtime considerations
  * cost(s)
    * promo/thank you/trinket/tchotchkes 

Host - (ultimately trying to minimize the hours put in to manage the different needs of people and shifts in scheduling when an anomaly is encountered)

* from a high level postion: (this would benefit professors and the like)
  * if you would like to schedule a once a week meeting with X number of people, this would allow those people to give possible times, and if people include some flexible prioritized time slots, then the scheduler would be able to schedule the most people without it being first come first serve reply.
* collection
     * of peoples shift preference
     * scheduled vs needed positions (attrition)
* distribution of schedules to people both scheduled and emergency via text/email/phone/phone tree            
* grouping of similar tasks

People (attempting to personalize this approach as much as possible)

* from a volunteer position:
  * A view to see open time slots and postions, including any hierarchal position structures (team lead/captain, worker, info, find raiser)
  * a short survey that would help you determine which area is most likely fitted to what you want/skilled at
  * priority/scheduled vs backup shifts
* from a paid perspective
  * clock/check in/out for timekeeping
  * invoicing for paycheck

All three will have considerations for typical organization trees and positions.
